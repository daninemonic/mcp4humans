  title: Review VSCode Extension Project
  description: A new VSCode extension project has been created using Yeoman generator
    under mcp4humans/. Review the basic extension structure, made for TypeScript support,
    esbuild bundler and npm package manager. Review the package.json has appropriate
    metadata, dependencies, and extension points. Add supporting packages such as
    prettier, eslint, etc. as needed

    section: VSCode Extension Considerations
    lines: 489-508
    content: "## VSCode Extension Considerations\n\nWhen implementing the VSCode extension\
      \ version of MCP4Humans, consider the following:\n\n### Integration Points\n\
      \n1. **VSCode Extension API**\n   - Use VSCode's extension API instead of Electron\n\
      \   - Leverage VSCode's UI components (webviews, panels, tree views)\n   - Use\
      \ VSCode's storage API for persistence\n\n2. **UI Adaptation**\n   - VSCode\
      \ has its own theming system - adapt the MCP4Humans theme to match\n   - Use\
      \ VSCode's built-in icons where appropriate\n   - Follow VSCode's UI patterns\
      \ and guidelines\n\n3. **State Management**\n   - VSCode extensions have their\
      \ own lifecycle\n   - Consider using the Memento API for persistent storage\n\
      \   - Handle extension activation/deactivation properly"
